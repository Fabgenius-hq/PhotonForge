1/6 Just launched PhotonForge™ — the open photonic interconnect toolkit that ends the AI memory wall.

Optical chiplets = 10-100x bandwidth, 1/10th power vs copper. Built for disaggregated AI racks (Blackwell-scale sims show +90% throughput).

NVIDIA/Meta/Google data centers need this NOW to scale beyond HBM limits.

Repo live: [github link here]
Raising $25M seed at $120M pre for hardware partners + open library tape-outs.
